# Get_next_line

This project will not only allow you to add a highly useful function to your collection,
but it will also teach you an important concept in C programming: static variables.


A variable declared as static inside a function:
- Is initialized only once.
- Keeps its value between function calls.
- Has function scope but static storage duration.

fd: file descriptor
- 0: std input
- 1: std output
- 2: std error

od -c gnl_test
od: octal dump: display contents in various format include non_printable characters.
-c: show each bite as a character
